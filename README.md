# QuadTree
An implementation of a quadtree is presented
Quadtree - is a space partitioning data structure. Its main advantage over other data structures is its adaptability. It provides good performance in insertion, deletion and search. That is, we can use this tree in a dynamic context where data changes frequently.

### The following methods are implemented in the project:
  1. Loading points from a file
  2. Inserting a point
  3. Deleting a point
  4. Getting the total number of points in the tree
  5. Getting points in a given range
  6. Checking the existence of a point in the tree



The data structure is implemented in c++
